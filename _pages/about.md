I am a technology enthusiast with special interest in the latest developments in the field of NLP. My research interests include machine learning and AI methods, and applications to topics in (directed) technological change, innovation economics and economic modelling. I obtained my Ph.D. from Justus-Liebig-University Gießen in 2022. During my Ph.D., I was employed at the ZEW – Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research as Researcher and Data Scientist working on policy projects related to industry dynamics and innovation as well as on economic indicator development from unstructured data sources using state-of-the-art transformer models.

Throughout my non-academic career, I have had the opportunity to work at some of the most reputable companies in the financial services industry, including Teambank, the German Federal Reserve Bank, and BMW Financial Services. In these roles, I have gained a wealth of experience in risk management, model development and data-driven decision making.
In my current position at BMW, I am responsible for developing and implementing statistical models to support decision making in the setting of residual values of used car vehicles. I have also played a key role in the implementation of machine learning algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our processes.

I am always excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to new projects and thereby contribute to the success of the team and the organization. Feel free to reach out to me via mail or message me on Twitter.
